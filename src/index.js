          "Marketing SOS course highly exgeeded my expectations! I used to cringe at the idea of marketing which in my honesty. I felt that honesty and marketing were mutually exclusive. But the reality is that I had to get my business out there and I required help from someone who understood my mindset and my market. This program changed my whole vision and gave me the tools to get into the game. Through learning this program, I was able to realize that I could indeed keep my honesty and make some serious hustling. Marketing SOS took me sone unexpected places inside myself and I was able to clear out some worthless stuff that was holding me back from my business potential. Roy's enthusiasm creates an enjoyable buzz and energy of making! He's generous, supportive,and keeps it real. It was great to be capable to connect with Roy and the other 'Hustlers' online and to capable to share how we were going on our marketing journeys. Roy's real-life, personal examples of methods in action motivated me to overcome my fears and take action on things I'd been putting off.",
